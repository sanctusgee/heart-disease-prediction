- **Feature Engineering**:
    - Defined relevant features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.
    - Created correlation matrices and pair plots to understand feature relationships.

- **Model Training**:
    - **Logistic Regression**: Used for its simplicity and interpretability.
    - **Decision Tree**: Applied GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters like `max_depth` and `min_samples_split`.
    - **Random Forest**: Leveraged ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy.
    - **Gradient Boosting**: Used for its ability to handle complex data patterns.
    - **Bagging Classifier**: Combined multiple models to reduce variance.
    - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Applied GridSearchCV to optimize `C` and `gamma` parameters.
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Implemented for its simplicity and effectiveness in certain scenarios.

#### Model Evaluation
- **Metrics Used**:
    - **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly predicted instances.
    - **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
    - **Recall**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
    - **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

- **Results**:
    - **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy: 0.57, Precision: 0.57, Recall: 0.34, F1-Score: 0.33
    - **Decision Tree**: Accuracy: 0.54, Precision: 0.64, Recall: 0.33, F1-Score: 0.27
    - **Random Forest**: Accuracy: 0.52, Precision: 0.46, Recall: 0.28, F1-Score: 0.26
    - **Gradient Boosting**: Accuracy: 0.48, Precision: 0.39, Recall: 0.23, F1-Score: 0.21
    - **Bagging**: Accuracy: 0.56, Precision: 0.39, Recall: 0.35, F1-Score: 0.36
    - **Support Vector Classifier**: Accuracy: 0.48, Precision: 0.90, Recall: 0.20, F1-Score: 0.13
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Accuracy: 0.44, Precision: 0.31, Recall: 0.19, F1-Score: 0.14

#### Visualizations
- **Heatmaps**:
    - **Decision Tree Grid Search Scores**: Visualized the performance of different hyperparameter combinations.
    - **Support Vector Classifier Grid Search Scores**: Highlighted the best performing hyperparameter combination.

#### Interpretation of Results
- **Logistic Regression**: Shows moderate accuracy and precision, indicating it can correctly identify heart disease in about 57% of cases. However, the recall is lower, suggesting it misses a significant number of actual heart disease cases.
- **Decision Tree**: Provides a balance between precision and recall, but overall accuracy is slightly lower than Logistic Regression. This model might be overfitting to the training data.
- **Random Forest**: Offers a good trade-off between precision and recall, but the overall performance is not significantly better than simpler models.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Shows lower accuracy and precision, indicating it may not be the best choice for this dataset.
- **Bagging**: Provides a balanced performance with decent accuracy and precision, making it a reliable choice.
- **Support Vector Classifier**: High precision but very low recall, meaning it correctly identifies heart disease cases but misses many actual cases.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Lowest performance among all models, indicating it may not be suitable for this dataset.

#### Conclusion
- **Model Performance**: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models showed relatively better performance in terms of accuracy and precision.
- **Challenges**: Handling imbalanced data and optimizing hyperparameters for complex models.
- **Future Work**: Explore advanced techniques like deep learning, feature selection, and ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.

#### Insights from the Data
- **Age and Heart Disease**: Older age groups show a higher prevalence of heart disease.
- **Cholesterol Levels**: Higher cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
- **Chest Pain Type**: Certain types of chest pain are strong indicators of heart disease.
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: Elevated resting blood pressure is a significant risk factor.
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved**: Lower maximum heart rates are associated with higher risk.
- **Exercise-Induced Angina**: Presence of exercise-induced angina is a strong indicator of heart disease.

These insights can help in understanding the key risk factors and improving early diagnosis and treatment strategies for heart disease.
